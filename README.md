# MotorVehicleCollision
We aimed to enhance data accessibility and reporting for safety initiatives. We processed 2.43M rows of US government data using Alteryx, designed dimensional models in Navicat, and built OLAP cubes with Talend. We also created 10+ dashboards in Power BI and Tableau to visualize accident trends, supporting data-driven decisions.
